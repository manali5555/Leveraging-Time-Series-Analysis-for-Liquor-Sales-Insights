# Leveraging-Time-Series-Analysis-for-Liquor-Sales-Insights

## Overview
This R-based project explores liquor sales forecasting through advanced time series analysis. It aims at enhancing stock management and sales strategies for liquor retailers by employing the ARIMA model to accurately predict sales trends and patterns.

## Dataset
The study utilizes a comprehensive dataset of monthly liquor sales, focusing on the ARIMA(0,0,0)(1,1,0)[12] model with drift for detailed forecasting. This dataset includes a variety of sales metrics essential for the analysis.

## Methodology
- **ARIMA Model**: Implementation of the ARIMA(0,0,0)(1,1,0)[12] with drift model for precise forecasting.
- **Time Series Decomposition**: Analyzes and isolates the data's trend, seasonality, and residuals.
- **Model Diagnostics**: Evaluation of residuals and autocorrelation to validate the model's effectiveness.
- **Evaluation**: Utilization of MAE, RMSE, and other metrics to assess forecast accuracy.

## Results
The ARIMA model successfully identifies a positive growth trend and consistent seasonal patterns. The model's forecast for the next two years demonstrates its capability for long-term prediction with reasonable accuracy.

## Requirements
- R environment
- Forecast package
- Tidyverse package for data manipulation and visualization

## Usage
To run this analysis:
1. Install R and the necessary packages.
2. Execute the R script provided for forecasting liquor sales.
3. Review the forecast accuracy through the metrics provided.

## Acknowledgements
The dataset for this project was sourced from Kaggle's Liquor Sales Dataset.
